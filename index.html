                    <p>
                        This master thesis was conducted in collaboration with the HR company Benify. 
                        The objective was to conduct rigorous user research in order to define the primary user groups, 
                        as well as their characteristics, needs, goals and challenges. Based on the gained insights, 
                        a new version of the platforms onboarding experience on the mobile app was prototyped.  
                        <br><br>
                        This research investigated how an onboarding process can increase users motivation
                        of returning to a digital platform. In order to aid the development of an onboarding 
                        process for Benify’s platform,
                        a customized design process incorporating aspects from Human-Centered Design,
                        Goal-Directed Design, and Participatory Design was utilized. Both qualitative
                        and quantitative research approaches were employed to collect and analyze user
                        data. Iterative prototyping, A/B testing, and heuristic evaluation of the prototype
                        was used to evaluate the design and its impact on participants’ perceived
                        motivation to engage with the platform.

                        <p>
                            As the number of software applications have dramatically increased, the market competition
                            has become higher as well. This denotes the importance of creating high
                            quality softwares and applications through applying a Human-Computer Interaction
                            approach to secure user retention. Although well designed system that follow established design principles can increase
                            likelihood of success, it is crucial to emphasize the importance of the first interaction
                            a user has with a system. The first experience a user gets with a website has a significant
                            impact on the impression they acquire from the site and can influence any
                            subsequent decisions regarding the site’s use. Designing a well-functioning onboarding is crucial as it is the first and only interaction
                            that every user experiences. Moreover, learnability is a central topic
                            in Human-Computer Interaction research, which is considered to be an essential
                            factor for securing success and user satisfaction. 
                            <br><br>
                            This research was done together with Benify, a large HR-company in Europe with
                            over 2 million users in 45 different countries. The company provides a web portal
                            where employers can offer their employees salary benefits and wellness contributions.
                            Benify need a better understanding of who their users are, and how their characteristics,
                            goals, needs and challenges may differ from one another. It has been noticed
                            that many users visit their platform only a few times a year, which is below the desired
                            usage rate, but there is currently not enough knowledge to manage this issue.
                            A proficient strategy for introducing new users to an application or website, with
                            the goal of user retention and long-term engagement, is by implementing a good
                            user onboarding process.

                                        <p>The Human-Centered Design (HCD) framework encourages designers to always put
                                            the human first when designing systems. The goal of HCD is to incorporate the
                                            user’s perspective into the development process in order to design a system that is
                                            easy to use.</p>

                                        <p>Users are ultimately motivated by their goals. By separating
                                            goals from tasks and activities and making design decisions based around these
                                            goals, user performance can be improved and unnecessary steps towards reaching
                                            these goals can be reduced. The Goal-Directed Design (GDD) framework always has
                                            the user goals in focus, and promotes scenario-based design techniques.</p>

                                            involved throughout the design process. It is an approach which invites the users
                                            to become partners in the development process, rather than being mere research
                                            subjects at the start or at the end of the design proces</p>

                        through the software Qlik Sense was examined. Data points from Qlik Sense was
                        collected and transferred into Google Sheets, where data visualizations were created
                        to make comparisons between user groups. By looking at this data, comparisons
                        between different user groups and variables could be made, and conclusions across
                        both user groups and all users could be drawn.</p>

                        performed in order to identify applications with a reputation of having successful
                        onboarding designs. Thus, a state of the art analysis was performed by conducting

                        Lastly, flowcharts were created for each persona. They were based on the same
scenario as the journey maps, and in essence conveyed the same journey as the
journey maps did. However, the journey maps were better at visualizing the user
personas user experience in terms of attitudes. The flowcharts on the other hand,
showed a more detailed view of how the personas navigated the platform and on
which pages they got stuck or were successful. They also included annotations
and tags that explained each user personas expectations, first impression, “aha!”-
moments, quick wins, attitudes and experiences, interaction styles, and conclusion
to the user journey.

                        Based on all the collective key findings from the scenario-based design methods and
the product teardowns, design strategies for the upcoming prototype of the project
were formulated using the previously formulated How Might We statements as a
framework.

                    <p>
                        Based on all of the feedback, insights, and results from previous methods, nine design
                        concepts were generated in Figma, a collaborative web application for interface
                        design [24]. As recruiting 5 participants have been proven to be enough to reach
                        saturation in usability tests [60], 5 participants were recruited to look at the prototypes
                        and express their opinions about them. The participants were recruited
                        through convenience sampling, where one of them was a Benify user.

                            The final prototype is devided into two parts: the registration which the user interacts
                            with before entering the platform, and in-app guides while the user is inside
                            the platform. The design decisions were based on the findings gathered throughout
                            the design process, specifically the onboarding frameworks collected during the literature
                            study, and insights gathered through the qualitative research methods.

                <p>
                    To investigate how the original onboarding and the new onboarding design affected
                    the overall user experience of the Benify mobile app, an A/B test in Maze was
                    conducted. The dependent variable for the test was which onboarding version the
                    participants were exposed to, which led to two groups: a control group which were
                    exposed to the original onboarding design, and an experiment group which were
                    exposed to the new onboarding design. After being exposed to their respective
                    onboarding variation, both groups were asked to perform a task inside the mobile
                    app. The independent variables were the eight survey questions that the participants
                    filled out at the end of the test.
